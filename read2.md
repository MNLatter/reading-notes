Choosing a text editor is a personl choice because they are all very similar. You have to find an editor that can help make a complete website. Making a complete website will need some key features like Code Completion, Syntax Highlighting, variety of themes, and a good selection of extensions. Code Completion allows you to start typing, display suggestions, and can even finish closing tags. You can color text with Syntax Highlighting. Emmet helps you with HTML and CSS.
