# Structure web pages with HTML

## WireFrame and Design
- WireFrame is a practice that allows UX designers to map out the design for a website, app, or product.
- The best tools for wireframing are pen and paper but you can also use websites like UXPin, and InVision.
- Before making a wireframe you must do your research and understand your audience.
  - You do this by user research and industry research.
 - The key principles to a good wireframe are clarity, confidence, and simplicity.
## Mozilla HTML Basics
- HTML is a markup language that is used to structure a webpage.
- HTML has an opening tag(<>) and a closing tag(</>).
- Between the opening tag and closing tag is the content.
- The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together makes an element.
- Elements can also have attributes that contain extra information.
- When you put two elements inside eachother it is called nesting.
- Elements with no content are called empty elements.
## Semantics
- Refers to the meaning of a piece of code.
- Semantic Element example
- <article>
- <aside>
- <details>
- <figcaption>
- <figure>
