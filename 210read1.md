## Structure 
- Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes tell us more about the elements.
- They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, seperated by an equal sign.
- The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements.
