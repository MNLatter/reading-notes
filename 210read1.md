# 201 Reading Notes

## Structure 
- Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes tell us more about the elements.
- They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, seperated by an equal sign.
- The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
## Extra Markup
1. Every HTML element can carry the id and class attribute.
2. Block elements are < h1 >,< p >, < ul >, and < li >.
3. Inline elements are < a >, < b >, < em >, and < img >.
4. < div > allows you to group a set of elements together in a oneblock-level box.
5. < span > is mostly used to control the appearance of the content of those elements using CSS.
6. < meta > element lives in the head and contains information about the web page.
7. < meta > is an empty element and does not have a closing tag.
8. Doctypes tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
9. < iframes > cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
## HTML5 Layout
- The new elements indicate the purpose of diffrent parts of a web structure and help describe its structure.
 - If a browser doesnt understand HTML5 it needs to be told which elements are block-level.
