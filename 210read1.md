# 201 Reading Notes 📖

## Structure 🏗️
- Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes tell us more about the elements.
- They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, seperated by an equal sign.
- The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
## Extra Markup 🖱️
1. Every HTML element can carry the id and class attribute.
2. Block elements are < h1 >,< p >, < ul >, and < li >.
3. Inline elements are < a >, < b >, < em >, and < img >.
4. < div > allows you to group a set of elements together in a oneblock-level box.
5. < span > is mostly used to control the appearance of the content of those elements using CSS.
6. < meta > element lives in the head and contains information about the web page.
7. < meta > is an empty element and does not have a closing tag.
8. Doctypes tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
9. < iframes > cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
## HTML5 Layout 📈
- The new elements indicate the purpose of diffrent parts of a web structure and help describe its structure.
  - If a browser doesnt understand HTML5 it needs to be told which elements are block-level.
## Process and Design 🖌️
1. Every website should be designed for the target audience. Ask why they are coming to your website and what are they trying to achieve
2. Wireframes are a great way to plan your website and organize.
3. Design is about communication and visual hiearchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
## The 🔤 of programming
- JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while its being viewed in the browser.
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (flowchart can help).
- Computers create models of the world using data.
