# Reflection and Discussion
##### Read: 01 Learning Markdown
After reading [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [Mastering Markdown on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) then watching [Github Markdown Syntax](https://pages.github.com/) I learned that markdown and html are  very similar with just minor variations and that Github pages lets you make websites for anything.
