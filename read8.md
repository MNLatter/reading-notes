# Loops and iteration
- Loops are a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
- Think of a loop as a computerized game where you tell someone take x steps this way then Y steps this way.
- A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
## Initial Expression
- Initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity.
- Can also declare variables.
## Condition Expression
- The expression is evaluated, if the value of condition expression is true, the loop statements execute.
- If the value of condition is false then the for loop terminates.
## Statement
- The statement executes.
## Expressions and Operators 
- Binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after ( operand1 operator operand2 ).
- A unary operator requires a single operand before or after operator ( operand operator or operator openrand ).
- An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
