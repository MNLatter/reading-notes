- < i > will make words appear *Italic*

## Introducing CSS üé®
- A CSS rule contains a selector and declaration.
- CSS treats each HTML element as it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different type of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
