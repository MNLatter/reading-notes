# Reflection and Discussion
##### Read: 01 Learning Markdown
After reading [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [Mastering Markdown on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) I learned that markdown and html are very similar. 
For example, # heading level 1 in markdown would read heading level 1. 
In HTML you would put <h1>heading level 1</h> and that reads heading level 1.
