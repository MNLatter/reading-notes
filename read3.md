## What is Git?

Git is a DVCS or Distributed version control that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. 
Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local rescources.
When you save a changed version of your project that is called a commit and any change you make to a file is tracked by git.
Files in Git can reside in three stages; Committed, Modified, and Staged.


- **Committed: Data is securley stored in a local data base.**

- **Modified: A file has been changed but not committed to database.**

- **Staged: Flagged a file's changed version to be committed to database.**
